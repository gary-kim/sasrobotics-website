**Warning:** Historically, we have had an abysmal success rate with robots built around tubes. Carefully consider whether this is really the best option!

The design adds a lot more difficulty and failiure points to your robot while only having questionable benefits. It is cool though :).

# CAD (Computer Assisted Design)

If there is any type of ROV that we build that requires a proper CAD to begin with, it is a tube bot. It will be of great help for figuring out bouyancy, center of bouyancy, center of mass, and a lot of other information about your design that will be very valuable.

While it does not matter which CAD software you used, consider looking into one that allows for automatic center of bouyancy and center of mass calulations.

# Waterproofing the Tube

Waterproofing a tube (officially a watertight enclosure) is a multi-step process. Please leave at least one week during your building time to waterproof the tube. You may also need up to 15 minutes to reseal and test every time you open the tube.

Make sure to always have spare parts on you. The ROV should be escorted by a few extra cable penetrators, seals, and all the tools needed to reclean and reseal the enclosure at all times.

The instructions here are more or less what is recommended by [Blue Robotics](https://bluerobotics.com) in the following guides:

* [Watertight Enclosure Assembly](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/watertight-enclosure-assembly-guide/)
* [Using the Vaccum Test Plug](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/using-the-vacuum-test-plug/)
* [WTE Vent Assembly Guide](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/wte-vent-assembly-guide/)
* [Potting a Cable Penetrator](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/potting-a-cable-penetrator/)

**Read through these instructions carefully and follow them to the last letter**. The biggest issues we have encountered have been from skipping steps on these instructions provided by Blue Robotics.

Also, follow these instructions every time you seal the enclosure. It is possible for dust, hair, or other foreign objects to get lodged in the seals whenever the tube is opened causing a potential leak.

If you run into any issues, Blue Robotics maintains a help forum for [Watertight Enclosures](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/c/product-support/watertight-enclosures).

## Cable Penetrators

Route cables through [cable penetrators](https://bluerobotics.com/product-category/cables-connectors/penetrators/) to get them in and out of the tube. 

The instructions for properly potting a cable penetrator is avaliable on the Blue Robotics website: [Potting a Cable Penetrator](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/potting-a-cable-penetrator/)

### Previous Mistakes
Add here as people come up with more ways to make mistakes :)

* Using hot glue for potting cable penetrators
    * Hot glue is unreliable and easily comes off when force is put on the cables. This is likely what caused the 2018 MATE robot to leak.
* Not leaving enough time for epoxy to set
    * We used marine epoxy and found that we did not have enough time before the skirmish to let the epoxy fully set. The epoxy we were using would require up to a week to set.

## Acrylic

Ensure that there are no cracks in the acryllic that could potentially allow water to leak into the tube.

---

# Frame

You may build the frame however you would like but keep in mind that it will have a few requirements:

* A location to mount the tube
* A tether holder to reduce stress on the cable penetrators

The tether point is essential as the cable penetrators cannot handle much stress before potentially leaking.

# Sensors

Take advantage of the fact that you do not need more cables to more sensors or servos to your robot. Definatly add a leak sensor to reduce potential damage while practicing.
