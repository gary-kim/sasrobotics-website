## Marine Advanced Technology Education

The Singapore American School Robotics team competes in MATE's Ranger class.

In MATE, we spend months to design, build, and code ROVs (Remote Operated Vehicles) to send them to compete in locations aroud the world. Students will encounter challenges while producing and piloting their robots, ranging from waterproofing difficulties to repairing broken down thrusters. Throughout this process students shall be tested on their creativity and enginnering skills as they bring their designs from both their CAD (Computer Assisted Design) and blueprints to life.

We and our robots then send the robots to competition to perform various tasks outlined competition manual for the year. These tasks range from easy tasks such as moving objects to their designated locations to very difficult tasks, such as identify drawings and objects with image recognition or have a seperate micro ROV to send into a small space for a visual check.

Every year, we send two of our best teams to the ASEAN MATE regional in Surabaya to compete for the opportunity to go to the MATE worlds competition.
