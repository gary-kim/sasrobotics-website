## FIRST Robotics Competition

## WE ARE TEAM 4817

Our team brings together enthusiastic and passionate students from the Singapore American School in Singapore. Our mission is identical to that of FIRST as a whole:

"to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting student-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership."

### Ingenuity & Creativity
As a robotics team, we encourage students to use and develop their critical thinking skills to create problem-solving ideas. Students' ideas are put to the test, and if they fail to complete the desired task, they are challenged to produce new ideas. Creativity plays an integral role in any robotics team, especially with given materials and guidelines. The FRC organization provides regulations that at times seem incredibly limiting, but with innovation, teamwork, and creativity, students can overcome obstacles and master skills pivotal to STEM careers. 

### Teamwork & Unity
As a robotics team, we are centered around communication. In any collaborative project, it is crucial for members to learn to effectively work with others by actively listening to their fellow team members, understanding the importance of receiving and giving feedback, and using diversity as an advantage. These skills allow our team to accomplish goals with efficiency and accuracy of work.
