### Ingenuity & Creativity
As a robotics team, we encourage students to use and develop their critical thinking skills to create problem-solving ideas. Students' ideas are put to the test, and if they fail to complete the desired task, they are challenged to produce new ideas. Creativity plays an integral role in any robotics team, especially with given materials and guidelines. The FRC organization provides regulations that at times seem incredibly limiting, but with innovation, teamwork, and creativity, students can overcome obstacles and master skills pivotal to STEM careers. 

### Teamwork & Unity
As a robotics team, we are centered around communication. In any collaborative project, it is crucial for members to learn to effectively work with others by actively listening to their fellow team members, understanding the importance of receiving and giving feedback, and using diversity as an advantage. These skills allow our team to accomplish goals with efficiency and accuracy of work.
